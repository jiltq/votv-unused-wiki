Welcome! This wiki documents unused/removed content from indie sci-fi game [Voices of the Void!](https://mrdrnose.itch.io/votv) I think game development history is very interesting, and maybe you do too!

Each wiki entry has its own markdown file found under `/docs`. If you'd like to contribute to the wiki, create an **issue**!
