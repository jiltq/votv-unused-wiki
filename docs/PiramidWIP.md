# Piramid WIP
`untitled_123.umap` contains 7 work-in-progress versions of the Piramid model!

## Version 1
This is the most rudimentary model, sporting only skinny legs.

Now with arms! The thrusters have also been shifted.

## Version 4
Same as version 3 but with weirdly smooth legs. The arms have also been tucked between the legs.

## Version 6
Now with much beefier legs! Lots of other details have been added such as engravings on the head and shifted thruster positions. However, the feet are weird and the arms are missing.

## Version 7
Arms have returned and so have the normal feet! The arms are beefed up from version 5 and now protrude confidently from the sides. This version is most similar to the model seen in-game.
